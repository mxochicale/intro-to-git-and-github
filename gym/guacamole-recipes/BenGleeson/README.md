**Ingredients**:
- 3 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 cup of diced onion (red onion preferred)
- 3 tablespoons of chopped fresh coriander
- 2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
- 1 teaspoon of minced garlic
- 1 pinch of ground cayenne pepper (optional)

**Instructions**:
- Mash the Avocados: In a medium bowl, use a fork or potato masher to mash the avocados. Leave it a bit chunky for texture.
- Add Lime Juice and Salt: Immediately add the lime juice and salt to the mashed avocados. This prevents oxidation and keeps the guacamole from turning brown.
- Mix Remaining Ingredients: Add the diced onion, chopped coriander, tomatoes, minced garlic, and cayenne pepper. Stir everything together until well mixed.
- Taste and Adjust: Taste your guacamole and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Sometimes it might need a bit more lime juice or salt.
- Serve Fresh: Guacamole is best enjoyed fresh, at room temperature. Serve it with tortilla chips or as a side to your favourite dishes.

**Pro Tip**
To store leftover guacamole and keep it green, place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the guacamole before refrigerating. This reduces air exposure and oxidation.


Enjoy your guacamole!
